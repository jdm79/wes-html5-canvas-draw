# Wes Bos JavaScript30 Challenge - Day 8

This is day 8 of Wes Bos's JavaScript challenge. This little project is all about HTML5 and using the canvas tools to make what is basically a really simple yet soothingly calming Microsoft Paint clone.

# How to install

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jdm79/wes-html5-canvas-draw.git
$ cd wes-html5-canvas-draw
$ open index.html
```

..then draw to your heart's content...
